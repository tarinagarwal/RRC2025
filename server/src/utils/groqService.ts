CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Write ONLY dialogue lines in the format "Alex: [dialogue]" and "Jordan: [dialogue]"
- Alternate between speakers naturally - don't have one person dominate
- Each speaker should have roughly equal speaking time
- Make it conversational with questions, responses, and back-and-forth discussion
- Keep responses SHORT and CONCISE to fit the ${duration} time limit
- Include natural speech patterns and conversational flow
- NO stage directions, NO descriptions, NO narrative text
- ONLY speaker dialogue lines

Knowledge Base:
${knowledgeBase}

Format Example:
Alex: Welcome everyone to today's podcast! I'm Alex, and I'm here with Jordan to discuss [topic].
Jordan: Thanks Alex! I'm really excited to dive into this topic because [reason].
Alex: Absolutely! So Jordan, what's your take on [specific aspect]?
Jordan: That's a great question. I think [response and elaboration].
Alex: Interesting point! That reminds me of [related concept]. What do you think about that?
Jordan: [Response and new question back to Alex]

Remember: ONLY dialogue lines with speaker names. No other text.
